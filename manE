$1 is always the file input
$2 is one of 3 other input
too add a custom input to a custom file:
use $1 to specify file to read
$2 for thing to delete
$3 add the keyword "cus" 
$4 add the word to replace
file is saved under "ab"(temp


TO RESET MAIN FILE:
use ./sc{script name} rest
and see the *magic* work ;)

TO STRESS TEST RESET:
./s {file name(has to already be resetted use CUS to get to 0 if not done)} str

TO HAVE A CUSTOM REPLACEMENT:
./sc {word to change into; also acts as filename} cus {word to remove}

TO CREATE A COPY WITH A CUSTOM WORD:
./sc {file name(has to be resetted else use custom option)} {word to change into; also acts as filename}

TO CHECK EVERY WORD EVER REPLACED, GO INTO THE FILE DIRECTORY AND CHECK THE log FILE.
